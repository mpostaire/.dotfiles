My dotfiles.

## Installation

TODO 

## TODO

- Better Readme
- Add cursor, icons and gtk theme (remake gtk colors so the are more like my color scheme).
- Better install script.

- calendarmenu: make day number of past/future month appear with a darker color

- musicmenu: find cover in folder first, then find it from the file (the latter cost more performances)

- bluetooth widget

- clipboard so when a program is closed the content copied inside it is still useable

- replace client borders by titlebars (not necessary but titlebar can have widgets)

- autoupdate script (with popups ?)

- popup_menu uses a lot of cpu when updating an item

- only one popup instance for each widget having a popup

- make a popup subclass wich make clicking outside hide itself

- --> place all widgets inside a container widget. if its width is too high, collapse (windows xp or windows 10 style) or make widgets without labels / with toggleable labels, then move music widget to the right area of the wibar

- script that git pull zsh plugins when necessary (take inspiration from this [link](https://github.com/TamCore/autoupdate-oh-my-zsh-plugins/blob/master/autoupdate.plugin.zsh))

- bluetooth widget
