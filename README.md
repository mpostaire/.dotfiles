## TODO

### high priority
- try a global background wibox for click outside events (have one wibox for all instances where we want click outside detection)

- toggle show popup controls and keygrabber inside control_widgets

- make mediakeys, etc work when popups like music player, calendar, etc

- notification when usb plugged/unplugged

- handle dbus proxy lost connection

- network menu

- clipboard so when a program is closed the content copied inside it is still useable

- redo alt tab menu

### low priority

- Better Readme
- Add cursor, icons and gtk theme (remake gtk colors so the are more like my color scheme).
- Better install script.
- make calendar days clickable + linked to a calendar app (maybe: make calendar widget side panel with events for the day + notifs like gnome calendar)
- music player: find cover in folder first, then find it from the file (the latter cost more performances)

- bluetooth widget
