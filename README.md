# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

# TODO

- Better Readme
- Add cursor, icons and gtk theme (remake gtk colors so the are more like my color scheme).
- Better install script.
- firefox and vscode forces focus on them when they are opened and cause non wanted desktop switch
- bspwm window placement rules

- calendarmenu: make day number of past/futur month appear with a darker color

- sometimes polybar won't launch for an unknown reason

- musicmenu: find cover in folder first, then find it from the file (the latter cost more performances)

- handle large notification + click links in notification + buttons in notification (maybe replace dunst)

- Port these settings inside awesomewm
