### high priority
- notification center
- make the applauncher keyboard input/scrollable list selection a standalone widget (e.g. to use in networkmanager widget). FIX weird bug
- notification when usb plugged/unplugged
- network menu
- clipboard so when a program is closed the content copied inside it is still useable
- redo alt tab menu

### low priority
- Better Readme
- redo awesomewm theme (it needs a little refresh)
- Add cursor, icons and gtk theme (remake gtk colors so the are more like my color scheme).
- Better install script.
- make calendar days clickable + linked to a calendar app (maybe: make calendar widget side panel with events for the day + notifs like gnome calendar)

- bluetooth widget
